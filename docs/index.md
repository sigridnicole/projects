## Work Experience (2017 - 2018)
During this period, although not using JavaScript as a language, I worked as a backend developer mainly for Banking and Financial Applications. Here's where I learned that I do like working on backend applications and database management, even though the screen was boring as hell. Which led me into looking for another technology or language that would give some color to my daily developer life, then I finally tried web development and the rest is history. :)
